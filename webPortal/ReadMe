for manual testing:
- front end testing excel file is included
- back end testing also included as an excel file (it is not completed because i found many missing parts in your source code)
noting that back end testing can't be manually.
I used microsoft excel 2007

for automation testing, i used Eclipse IDE for Java Developers Version: 2020-12 (4.18.0) using selenium and TestNG and maven
